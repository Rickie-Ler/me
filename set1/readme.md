TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
according to my first programming I had learn that need to test after done my first programming
to be honest I still unclear of the word commit, push it's similar to google drive but I still confuse
I know programming think first before type and always save my work
I stil confuse the world terminal, github, visual studio code, python, python is a language? VCis a code? Github is central space for our work be store and coordinate but how about terminal?Also, sometimes it apperars The term'XX' is not recongized how can we solve?
In conclusion, It's my first week still confused but fun
